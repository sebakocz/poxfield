## :thread: Deckstring Info
Deckstrings are a compact way to represent a deck of cards using a Base62 encoding. The deckstring format separates different card types (champions, spells, equipment, and relics) with hyphens. Champions have an additional character to encode their abilities.

### Structure
A deckstring has the following structure:

[champions]-[spells]-[equipment]-[relics]

Each section represents a type of card, and each card within a section is represented by its Base62 encoded ID. The encoded IDs for each card type are concatenated together to form a single string.

### Example
Deckstring: [AYCAYC4OC4OCLg13pB2w14Z01GC1H1QcBSZ1IsMSc07Q2-6T2m200Z8X1y0i6A1f-1w0l2V-4A0d24](https://sebakocz.github.io/poxfield/?deck=AYCAYC4OC4OCLg13pB2w14Z01GC1H1QcBSZ1IsMSc07Q2-6T2m200Z8X1y0i6A1f-1w0l2V-4A0d24)

This deckstring can be broken down into the following sections:
- Champions: AYCAYC4OC4OCLg13pB2w14Z01GC1H1QcBSZ1IsMSc07Q2
- Spells: 6T2m200Z8X1y0i6A1f
- Equipment: 1w0l2V
- Relics: 4A0d24

### Champions and Abilities
Champions are a special case since they also have abilities. The abilities are encoded as an additional Base62 character after the champion's ID. The first two characters represent the champion's ID, while the third character represents the encoded abilities.

For example, in the champions section of the example deckstring, AYC represents a champion with ID AY (=2292) and abilities encoded as C (=12) which is split index ability indexes 1 & 2.
